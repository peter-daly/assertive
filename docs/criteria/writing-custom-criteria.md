# Writing custom criteria

Assertive comes with it's own built in criteria but you can add your own custom criteria if you want add more richness to your assertions.

There are a number of ways of creating custom criteria.

1. Extending the `Criteria` class and writing custom match methods
2. Extending the `WrappedCriteria` class and composing a new criteria type from pre existing onces.
